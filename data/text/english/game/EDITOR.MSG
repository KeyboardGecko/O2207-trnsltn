# Karma description strings
#
{1100}{}{This is a ranged stat that represents your general reputation. The higher the number, the better known and respected you are. If your rep is negative, you are hated by some for your evil actions.}
{1101}{}{You have killed children, the youth of the wasteland. This is considered to be a really bad thing. You evil, evil person.}
{1102}{}{This is it, you are now the God of Olympus! How much I had to go through, but it was worth it! But what to do with such power?}
{1103}{}{You have killed a large number of people. This is generally not a good thing to get known for. People from the wrong side of the track will like you a little more, however.}
{1104}{}{You thoroughly enjoy Spot-Up, the brown and warm soda of the post-nuclear world.}
{1105}{}{You are addicted to the chem Stronghold. You must take this chem on an ongoing basis or suffer the effects of withdrawal.}
{1106}{}{You are suffering from Brainiac addiction. You must take this particular chem or suffer withdrawal.}
{1107}{}{You have a chem addiction. If you do not take Combatid on a regular schedule, you will suffer. If you do, others will suffer.}
{1108}{}{Your body has become addicted to Rad-Out. While not life threatening, you must take it regularly.}
{1109}{}{You have a problem with alcohol. Actually, you have many problems with your drinking habits.}
{1110}{}{You have a chem addiction. You must take Drop on a regular basis.}
{1111}{}{Tragically, you are hooked on the Garnering. You are constantly in search of new expansions.}
{1112}{}{TEMPORARY - What is this?}
{1113}{}{You decided to direct all the resources of the skyscraper to the needs of the inhabitants of the Wasteland, even though this makes Olympus defenseless against robbers and marauders.}
{1114}{}{You diligently agitated the inhabitants of Tartarus to serve the fictional Gods, and they began to work harder. Food and water became abundant and many unrest was quelled. Lying for salvation?}
{1115}{}{You diligently convinced the people of Tartarus that they were being fooled, and that there were no gods. Many threw down their work and more unrest arose. There is less food and water but more cruelty from the "Gods".}
{1116}{}{You managed to incite a retaliatory squadron of Olympus to the Caves of the Undead! Rejoice, nobody left alive there.}
{1117}{}{You did a nice job of making the soil in the Undeath Caves a little more fertile, and the harvest a little richer. Rejoice, now they live a little easier.}
{1118}{}{Betrayals, secret murders, deception, denunciations ... Who cares? Winners are not judged! You are now the leader of the Sunset Jackals!}
{1119}{}{Intrigues of intrigue and long-standing family feuds - you unraveled everything, and even took the post of Supervisor in the New World Order Cannery! Well, now you are definitely provided with canned food.}
{1120}{}{It is not easy to be the head of four crazy families in Laivos, but in a crazy world there are crazy rules. Oh, and why are the vault residents calling you "Overseer"?}
{1121}{}{Controlling drugs and narcotics is not everyone's dream in the Wastes. You made that dream come true and now control the entire Rainbow Raiders community under your iron fist!}
{1122}{}{How is that even possible? Four groups that hate each other, and you managed to become the head figure in each of them! Bravo!}
{1123}{}{You are a famous seeker of old world governmental, scientific or other secrets... and of course the loot therein. Finding the unknown is your motto!}
{1124}{}{How many locks you've opened and collected either useful items or garbage... Truly, your hands can work wonders with locks!}
{1125}{}{You have thoroughly decided to tackle this business. How many women have passed through you? A hundred? Two? Maybe it's time to go to the doctor and get yourself checked?}
{1126}{}{"They're dead, they don't care," has become your motto. Digging up the remains of others is more than a hobby for you.}

{2104}{}{You're just another out-of-towner in this area. Probably up to no good.}

{2106}{}{Staring and muttering, some cross the street to avoid walking near you, while others spit and turn away when you come near. Everyone knows that you're one of the worst things that's ever slithered into this area.}

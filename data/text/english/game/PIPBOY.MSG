{1016}{}{military base is now our new home. This is where }
{1017}{}{we'll settle, where we'll start building our new}
{1018}{}{empire, the New Radius. Anyone who stands in our}
{1019}{}{way will be wiped out, crushed, destroyed like}
{1020}{}{these pussies who tried not to let us in here!}

{1027}{}{It's not so bad here, actually. The vagrants}

{1029}{}{leaving all the weapons inside to us. Half the}

{1031}{}{and they'll be as good as new. Dealing with the}

{1038}{}{Holy Wasteland! We were seriously battered by }

{1040}{}{went to Hell tonight! Fucking bastards came in }

{1042}{}{through the front bother to call for backup!}
{1043}{}{Naive, arrogant assholes! Maybe their armor gives}
{1044}{}{them a good protection from radiation and shit,}
{1045}{}{but they didn't stand a chance against two}
{1046}{}{miniguns! Too bad the suits are torn to bits, I}
{1047}{}{could use one. Still, the engines of the three}
{1048}{}{"Predators" turned out to be intact. Smartie will}
{1049}{}{attach them to the machinery, and we will be able}
{1050}{}{to mostly replenish our arsenal. Next time we'll}
{1051}{}{be able to fight back any asshole coming to us!}

{1060}{}{it wasn't for the info he brought, I'd have torn}
{1061}{}{his arms off, ripped his belly open and feed guts}
{1062}{}{to the dogs. 6 Jackals killed, one captured, and}
{1063}{}{one escaped, that rat... So, the thing is that}
{1064}{}{there's a fortified facility in the south part of}
{1065}{}{Radius, the New World Order or something. They}
{1066}{}{make some kind of canned food out of mutants.}
{1067}{}{It's not much of a delicacy, but still edible…}
{1068}{}{And a lot safer than hunting Ursa. Their security}
{1069}{}{is shit, they don't have a lot of guns, and we}
{1070}{}{could just kill them one by one on the street.}
{1071}{}{But if they decide to barricade inside the}
{1072}{}{factory… We need to find the way to lure them}
{1073}{}{out. In the meantime, let's trade our most rusty}

{1083}{}{my right hand. I don't even know what kind of}

{1085}{}{together with all the meat and the bones... Shit…}
{1086}{}{It all took them about 30 minutes, tops. These}

{2000}{}{Researching the anti-radiation painkiller drug.}
{2001}{}{...}
{2002}{}{September 30, 2183}
{2003}{}{Although radiation is visibly dropping in the }
{2004}{}{most known areas of Radius, and Seekers don't die}
{2005}{}{as quickly, there is a demand for developing a}
{2006}{}{new drug to help them on long-range missions.}
{2007}{}{The most sensible thing to do would be to try}
{2008}{}{to synthesize something that has the properties}
{2009}{}{of a painkiller, a stimulant and a}
{2010}{}{radiation-removing agent. Obviously, the}
{2011}{}{experiments should begin with an in-depth study}
{2012}{}{of the "RadOut" properties. Fortunately, several}
{2013}{}{pre-war documents on Rainbow Pharmaceuticals }
{2014}{}{are still readable. Well, let's get started.}
{2015}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2016}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2017}{}{December 26, 2183}
{2018}{}{For many days and nights now, I'm unsuccessfully}
{2019}{}{trying to find out the base "RadOut" component. }
{2020}{}{The formula described in the pre-war data is}
{2021}{}{purely synthetic, it doesn't tell me anything. So,}
{2022}{}{the only available option left is to study the}
{2023}{}{wildlife that developed resistance to the}
{2024}{}{radiation. Let's start with the scorpions.}
{2025}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2026}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2027}{}{May 12, 2184}
{2028}{}{Yes! There's no doubt that the secretions of ant}
{2029}{}{lions have a powerful rad-extracting properties.}
{2030}{}{After a special pressurized treatment, of course.}
{2031}{}{A shame I had so much time wasted on studying}
{2032}{}{scorpions, but that's beside the point.}
{2033}{}{Now, let's begin our experiments!}
{2034}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2035}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2036}{}{July 13, 2184}
{2037}{}{The test subjects are reacting extremely poorly to}
{2038}{}{the effects of the "Drop". That's the name I gave}
{2039}{}{the drug. They show all the signs of severe }
{2040}{}{intoxication, and there have already been two}
{2041}{}{lethal cases... No one wants to try my medication}
{2042}{}{willingly. There's a chance I'll have to resort}
{2043}{}{to self-testing… But this is for later. For now,}
{2044}{}{I need to find an antidote to formic acid…}
{2045}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2046}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2047}{}{December 01, 2184}
{2048}{}{That's it! I found it! Scorpion venom perfectly}
{2049}{}{neutralizes formic acid! I should proceed to the }
{2050}{}{experiments, fast! Hmm... Actually, one of}
{2051}{}{recently returned Seekers shows severe signs}
{2052}{}{of anemia. Convenient.}
{2053}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2054}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2055}{}{January 05, 2185}
{2056}{}{Everything is going great. Ben is recovering,}
{2057}{}{feeling better every minute, taking one "Drop" a}
{2058}{}{day. He seems more irritable, but the improvement}
{2059}{}{of his health condition is evident!}
{2060}{}{Time to start the production!}
{2061}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2062}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2063}{}{January 07, 2185}
{2064}{}{Something's wrong... The dramatic improvement of}
{2065}{}{Ben's well-being was followed by an even sharper}
{2066}{}{decline in his... uh... mental stability. }
{2067}{}{He's acting like an animal, wheezing, snapping, and}
{2068}{}{this morning he tried to chew his own arm off...}
{2069}{}{Maybe it's because of his body properties - he's a}
{2070}{}{ghoul after all. Or maybe he took too big of a}
{2071}{}{dose. Now I'm sure that no one's would want to}
{2072}{}{volunteer on testing the drug. I have to adjust}
{2073}{}{the ratio of ingredients in the compound, and}
{2074}{}{prepare for testing the chemical on myself...}
{2075}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2076}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2077}{}{January 12, 2185}
{2078}{}{No one liked him anyway. And why bury a dead guy}
{2079}{}{into the ground when you can feed him to our ant}
{2080}{}{lions? I need them alive for experiments…}
{2081}{}{There are only three of them left, so I}
{2082}{}{decided not to change the drug's composition.}
{2083}{}{I have a theory that Ben died because of some}
{2084}{}{peculiarities of his ghoul body. As soon as the}
{2085}{}{ants are done with him and gain some weight,}
{2086}{}{I'll make more "Drop". Going to try it out.}
{2087}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2088}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2089}{}{January 15, 2185}
{2090}{}{Oooh... Mmmm... Hehehey! Yeahhhhhh...}
{2091}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2092}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2093}{}{January 16, 2185}
{2094}{}{That... was... wonderful... I think I've seen the}
{2095}{}{gods of the wasteland... I know, I know it sounds}
{2096}{}{crazy, but it was so... real! The "Drop" took my}
{2097}{}{mind to some other world, a perfect world...}
{2098}{}{I need to make... more...}
{2099}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2100}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2101}{}{January 26, 2185}
{2102}{}{It's a monstrous drug. I can say it, but I can't}
{2103}{}{make myself realize it... The "Drop" has many}
{2104}{}{powerful effects, but the strongest one is,}
{2105}{}{without any doubt, the worst kind of addiction.}
{2106}{}{I have no ant lions left, so I need to send our}
{2107}{}{Seekers to get some. I think I'll give them a}
{2108}{}{sample of my drug, so they wouldn't ask too}
{2109}{}{many questions…}
{2110}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2111}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2112}{}{January 30, 2185}
{2113}{}{My body is twisting immensely! God!!! The bastard}
{2114}{}{ripped out my freshly-made supply and devoured it}
{2115}{}{in an instant! Serves him right... His human body}
{2116}{}{surrendered almost immediately - he literally spat}
{2117}{}{out his bloody guts. I think the drug has this}
{2118}{}{severe effect because… It's because I made the}
{2119}{}{"Drop" out of the ants that ate Ben... And I got}
{2120}{}{five more ants… Hungry fucking ants...}
{2121}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2122}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2123}{}{February 03, 2185}
{2124}{}{Phew... Well, it wasn't that hard. I just had to}
{2125}{}{pretend that the ghoul wanted to eat my newborn}
{2126}{}{baby girl. I'm a scientist, after all, and he's a }
{2127}{}{ghoul. Nobody believes ghouls. But my... my hunch}
{2128}{}{was confirmed completely: eating the ghoul's flesh}
{2129}{}{makes the ant lions produce another, different}
{2130}{}{kind of formic acid! And that acid is... It is...}
{2131}{}{It is the new, delightful world of The "Drop"!}

{5028}{}{ causing blindness, unluckily for him}
{5029}{}{, and with no protection there, causing serious pain}
{5030}{}{, and blinding him with a stunning blow}
{5031}{}{. The loss of an eye is too much for him, and he falls to the ground}
{5032}{}{, sadly, he is too busy feeling the rush of air on the brain to notice death approaching}
{5033}{}{. Ouch! That had to hurt}
{5034}{}{, and he's not wearing a cup, either}
{5035}{}{ and without protection, he falls over, groaning in agony}
{5036}{}{. The pain is too much for him and he collapses like a rag}

{5133}{}{. She takes it like a man. That is to say, it hurts}

{5205}{}{. The left arm of this kid now has an owie}
{5206}{}{, throwing the small child off balance}
{5207}{}{, breaking that arm with a loud snap. Some serious tears start to flow}
{5208}{}{, easily snapping that arm like a small piece of candy}
{5209}{}{. The right arm starts to swell, like a balloon}

#   PERK DESCRIPTIONS
#
{1101}{}{With Awareness, you are given detailed information about any critter you examine. You see their exact hit points and information about any weapon with which they are equipped.}
{1102}{}{You have learned the secret arts of the East, or perhaps you just punch faster.  In any case, your hand-to-hand attacks cost 1 AP less to effect.}
{1103}{}{Experience in unarmed combat has given you the edge when it comes to damage.  You cause +2 points of damage with hand-to-hand and melee attacks for each level of this perk.}
{1104}{}{For each level of Bonus Move, you get 2 free APs each turn that can only be used for movement.  In other words, you can move 2 free hexes each turn for each level of this perk.}
{1105}{}{Your training in firearms and other ranged weapons has made you more deadly in ranged combat.  For each level of this perk, you do +2 points of damage with ranged weapons.}
{1106}{}{This perk allows you to pull the trigger a little faster and still remain as accurate as ever.  Each ranged weapon attack costs 1 AP less to perform.}
{1107}{}{You are more likely to move before your opponents in combat, since your Sequence is +2 for each level of this perk.}
{1108}{}{With each level of this perk, you get a +2 bonus to your Healing Rate.  This is cumulative with your normal healing rate, and thus you heal faster.}
{1109}{}{You are more likely to cause critical hits in combat if you have this perk.  Each level of More Criticals garners you an additional +5% chance to cause a critical hit.}
{1110}{}{With the Night Vision perk you can see better in darkness, reducing darkness penalties in combat by 20%.}
{1111}{}{You command attention by just walking into a room.  The initial reaction of another person is improved by 10% for each level of this perk.}
{1112}{}{You are better able to avoid radiation and the bad effects radiation causes.  Each level of this perk improves your Radiation Resistance by 15%.}
{1113}{}{When you're tough, you take less damage.  Each level of this perk adds +10% to your general damage resistance.}
{1114}{}{AKA Mule.  You can carry an additional 50 pounds of equipment for each level of this perk.}
{1115}{}{You have a talent for hitting things at longer distances.  For each level of this perk, you get a +2 bonus to Perception for the purposes of determining range modifiers.  It's easier than ever to kill at long range!}
{1116}{}{With this perk, you gain the ability to move quickly while remaining quiet.  You can sneak and run at the same time, as otherwise you would automatically cease sneaking when running.}
{1117}{}{You are a master of the outdoors.  This perk confers the ability to survive in hostile environments.  You get a +25% bonus to Outdoorsman.}
{1118}{}{You have mastered one aspect of bartering-- buying goods far more cheaply than normal. With this perk, you get a 25% discount when purchasing items from a store or another trader.}
{1119}{}{Each level of Educated adds +2 skill points when you gain a new experience level. This perk works best when purchased early in your adventuring career.}
{1120}{}{The healing of bodies comes easier to you with this perk. With each level of this perk you may heal 4-10 additional hit points when using the First Aid or Doctor skills.}
{1121}{}{You have a talent for finding money. You find additional money in random encounters in the desert.}
{1122}{}{The critical hits you cause in combat are now more devastating. You gain a 20% bonus on the critical hit table, almost ensuring more damage will be dealt. This does not affect your chance to cause a critical hit.}
{1123}{}{You have studied other human beings, giving you an uncanny insight into their emotional reactions to you.  You will see the reaction level of the person you are talking to when involved in an in-depth conversation.}
{1124}{}{The Slayer walks the earth!  In hand-to-hand combat all your hits are upgraded to critical hits, wreaking maximum mayhem and carnage on your foes.}
{1125}{}{You have mastered the firearm as a source of pain.  With this perk, any successful hit in combat with a ranged weapon will be upgraded to a critical hit if you also make a Luck roll.}
{1126}{}{While Sneaking, if you hit a critter in the back you will cause double damage if using a hand-to-hand attack.  Silent Death is just that kind of perk.}
{1127}{}{Each level of Action Boy (or Action Girl, if you wish) gives you an additional AP to spend every combat turn.  You can use these generic APs on any task.}
{1128}{}{Mental Block is the ability to tune out any outside mental interference.  You must have learned this talent from a passing guru, or from a really late night at a bar.}
{1129}{}{With each level of this perk, you gain an additional 4 Hit Points every time you advance a level.  This is in addition to the hit points you already gain per level based on your endurance.}
{1130}{}{You are less likely to be hit in combat if you have this perk. You gain a +5 to your Armor Class, in addition to the AC bonus from any armor worn.}
{1131}{}{Yum! Tastes like chicken. For each level of this perk, you become inured to some toxins and gain +25% to your Poison Resistance.}
{1132}{}{This perk gives you a one-time bonus of +10% to the Repair and Science skills.  A little late night cramming never hurt anybody, especially you.}
{1133}{}{The Medic perk gives you a one-time bonus of +10% to the First Aid and Doctor skills.  Healing skills are a good thing.}
{1134}{}{A Master Thief is proficient at stealing and picking locks. You gain +15 to Stealing and Lockpicking.  Steal from the rich, and give to you.}
{1135}{}{Being a Speaker means you earn a one-time bonus of +20% to your Speech skill.  From the mouth of babes and all that.}
{1136}{}{Each level of the Heave Ho! Perk gives you an additional +2 to Strength (up to 10) for purposes of determining range with thrown weapons only. This Perk will not exceed a weapon's maximum range.}
{1137}{}{ERROR.UNIMPED!}
{1138}{}{You are much more adept at stealing than the average crook. You can pick pockets with the best of them, because with this perk you ignore size and facing modifiers when stealing from a person.}
{1139}{}{When the sun goes down or you're in a poorly lit area, you move like a ghost with this perk.  Your Sneak skill is enhanced +20% in dark conditions.}
{1140}{}{Your reputation is always positive to people. Without this perk, a large negative reputation would have a bad effect on good natured people. This works in the reverse as well. Evil people will even treat a Goodie Two Shoes as one of the gang.}
{1141}{}{You manage to find more ammo than the normal wasteland scavenger. This perk doubles the amount of ammo found in random encounters.}
{1142}{}{The mark of the Explorer is to search out new and interesting locations.  With this perk, you have a greater chance of finding special places and people.}
{1143}{}{With this perk you are less likely to be addicted to chems (50% less likely), and you suffer half the withdrawal time of a normal person.}
{1144}{}{This perk is obselete. Adjust your ddraw.ini file to modify your world map travel speed.}
{1145}{}{Animals will not attack one of their friends, unless the animal is threatened or attacked first.  Exactly what counts as an animal in this mutated wastlenad is open to debate.}
{1146}{}{You have improved your ability to see distant locations, increasing the size of explorations on the World Map by one square in each direction.  You also have a better chance of finding special encounters.}
{1147}{}{With this perk you gain the attention of a Mysterious Stranger, who will appear to help you combat foes from time to time.  If your ally is lost in combat, do not expect him (or her) to be replaced.}
{1148}{}{You gain +15% toward your Outdoorsman skill.  You are more likely to avoid random encounters if you choose, and tend to find those "special" encounters more than most.}
{1149}{}{You have learned to pack your equipment more efficiently.  Accessing your inventory only costs you 2 Action Points in combat instead of 4.}
{1150}{}{You have learned to increase your dialog options without understanding what you're talking about.  Each level of this perk will increase your Intelligence by one, up to 10, for purposes of dialogue only.}
{1151}{}{You are indeed a Swift Learner with this perk, as each level gives you an additional +5% bonus whenever you earn experience points.  This perk is best taken early in your career.}
{1152}{}{Your skills have improved to the point where you can pick an additional Tag Skill.  Tag skills increase twice as fast.}
{1153}{}{The radiation of the wasteland has changed you!  One of your Traits has mutated into something else...}
{1154}{}{You crave another Spot-Up.}
{1155}{}{You feel the crash of going from hero to zero hard without a regular dose of Stronghold, and you've got the shakes.}
{1156}{}{You feel confused, and the world around you seems hard to understand without a fix of tasty Braniac.}
{1157}{}{You feel light-headed, depressed, and lethargic. What's the point of going on anymore without a regular dose of Combatid?}

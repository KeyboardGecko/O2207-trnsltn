{3}{}{You see fresh brickwork.}
{4}{}{It is noticeable that the bricks have just been laid. The cement also looks so weak that you can pierce it with your finger.}

# Действия
{5}{}{You managed to pull out a couple of bricks with a little effort. It makes a whole part of the wall crumble down.}
{6}{}{Fresh brickwork can't hold the explosion. The wall folds like a house of cards.}
{7}{}{Uh, no, that does not do anything.}
{8}{}{How do you think it should work!?}
{9}{}{Maybe it needs a little push? Perhaps, some blowing onto?}
{10}{}{Looks like you lack the strength to break it.} 
{11}{}{You have not enough strength to bring down the wall with this.}
{12}{}{It's... A corpse! It's the Son of Gods!}

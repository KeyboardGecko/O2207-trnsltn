{1}{}{You see: a wall.}
{2}{}{It looks like any other wall.}

{3}{}{You see: a fresh brickwork.}
{4}{}{It's pretty noticeable that the bricks are freshly laid. The cement also looks so weak it could be pulled out with a finger.}

# Действия
{5}{}{With little effort, you manage to pull out a couple of bricks. It makes a whole piece of the wall to crumble down.}
{6}{}{Fresh brickwork can't hold the explosion. The wall folds like a house of cards.}
{7}{}{Uh, no, that does not do anything.}
{8}{}{How do you think it should work!?}
{9}{}{Maybe it needs a little kick? Perhaps, some blowing onto?}
{10}{}{Looks like you lack strength to break it.}
{11}{}{You have not enough strength to bring down the wall with this.}
{12}{}{Could it be... the corpse! It is Son of Gods' corpse!}

{10}{}{[the man looks at you for some time. Then he suddenly breaks silence with quiet, but strong voice] New?}

{11}{002}{Yeah, kinda. And you are? Old?}
{12}{003}{Yes. By the way, nice town you have here.}
{13}{004}{[lie] No, actually I am already living here for a long time. I guess you didn't recognize me...}
{14}{999}{[pretend you didn't hear him and walk away]}


{20}{}{[he gets quiet again, probably thinking about the next thing to say. His studying look is still coming through you] I'm afraid there's no place here for ones like you. We have nothing to talk about. At least for now... Probably, we can try again later - if you are capable of showing that you can be trusted. [without waiting for your reaction, he turns back to some papers]}
{21}{005}{Such manners. Can I ask your name, at least?}
{22}{005}{What's your name then?}


{30}{}{A good manners in Radius. Good. Welcome to NWO. Most likely, you are familiar with the rules by now. I can only additionally empathize that I strongly recommend to follow them. My name is Mark. I do the duty to my town by managing things here and keeping it safe. Unfortunately, there are some problems presented at the moment, so I don't have any time to spare speaking to you. Probably, if situation changes, I could be available for conversation. [he turns away from you and starts going through some papers, indicating that this dialog is over]}
{31}{999}{Umm... Well... Was nice meeting you, Mark.}
{32}{999}{[silently turn back and go away]}


{40}{}{Really? What's my name then?}
{41}{006}{Uh... Steve?}
{42}{006}{Kyle?}
{43}{006}{Leonard?}
{44}{007}{Okay, you got me. I'm here recently.}


{50}{}{[he doesn't even look in your direction] Mark, in charge of this settlement.}
{51}{999}{Well, it was, "nice" meeting you, "Mark". }
{52}{999}{[silently turn back and go away]}


{60}{}{[he patiently looks at you and waits]}
{61}{007}{What?}
{62}{007}{Is that incorrect? I was sure I've beaten my sclerosis...}


{70}{}{The name's Mark, I'm in charge of this settlement. And I definitely don't have time to fool around. This place is not for the likes of you. We have nothing to talk about. [he pondered] At least for now... But probably, we can try again later - if you are capable of showing that you can do something more useful for the town than wasting my time. [he turns away from you and starts to look through some documents]}
{71}{999}{[end the conversation]}


{100}{}{[Mark takes his eyes off some old journal in plain dark-green cover, now he's looking at you, waiting for you to say something]}
{101}{013}{I've recently helped some of your folks...}
{102}{012}{[lie] I've recently helped some of your folks...}
{103}{011}{I'm just wandering around. Looking for what I can do for the town.}
{104}{018}{I wanted to talk to you about Sam and Lucy...}
{105}{024}{So... I think I've done it. Sam and Lucy apologized to each other and gave their word that they will behave in the future.}
{106}{031}{Can you tell me about this town?}
{107}{062}{Mark... I'd like to talk about your successor, the future head of the settlement.}
{108}{103}{Hey, Mark! What's up?}
{112}{108}{I'd like to talk about Skeet.}
{109}{999}{Nothing, just walking around. I see you are busy. I'll come by later.}


{110}{}{Here? }
{111}{999}{Okay. I got it, already leaving...}


{120}{}{Is that so? [he stops what he has been doing and moves closer] I asked people to keep an eye on you. If you would do something, I would immediately knew. So, stop wasting my time! Go make yourself useful or try your luck somewhere else. With the Jackals, for example. They like your kind. }
{121}{999}{Okay, okay! I'm going!}


{130}{}{Good [he nods], so I've been told. So, does it feel good to help people?}
{131}{015}{Yeah, sure.}
{132}{014}{Frankly, not much. I prefer not to waste myself on charity - 'cause I don't produce batteries in my basement out of nothing.}


{140}{}{It's good that you are honest about this. Much better than lie. I appreciate honesty.}
{141}{016}{[keep listening]}


{150}{}{So, yes, we could find some use of your services. Kindness, loyalty and reliability are not common qualities of people in Radius, unfortunately...}
{151}{016}{[keep listening]}


{160}{}{I have a small favor to ask. It's personal. You are new here, so you have clean, undjudged look. It can be helpful in solving one little problem. You are, probably, already met Sam and Lucy. The former is my friend and my grandfather. The latter is my wife. And I'd be damned if there's at least one day without them quarreling! Every day, any reason.}
{161}{017}{Family stuff... Is that even okay to put a stranger like me into this?}
{162}{018}{Such a strange request. For a start, I have some questions about this... "problem".}
{163}{019}{Well... Any whim for your batteries...}
{164}{020}{Frankly speaking, i'm not the best therapist. Actually, I'm not therapist at all!}


{170}{}{I agree, it might look stupid. The thing is - no one here wants to try anymore. Most of them already did... It's impenetrable... But, as I said, you are a fresh person with undjudged look.}
{171}{018}{Well... maybe I'll take the job. Still, I need to know more about Sam and Lucy...}
{172}{019}{I think I'll handle it. For a price, of course.}
{173}{020}{Honestly, I doubt I will be of any help. Especially, if even close friends and relatives are already tried to do something with it and failed.}


{180}{}{Of course. I'll try to give you the answers to all of your questions.}
{181}{021}{Tell me about reasons of their mutual dislike for each other.}
{182}{022}{Tell me about Sam.}
{183}{023}{Tell me about Lucy.}


{190}{}{The reward will be worth it, I promise. I have some... Available resourses. Personal resourses, don't take me wrong!}
{191}{018}{Well... Okay. Why not? I'm not making any promises, but I'll try. I have some questions about this "problem".}


{200}{}{I don't think that it's the main thing to focus on. Just try to hear both of them out, to convince them that you are not allied with the other one- [he suddenly bends over, coughing. After he stands up, wiping the sweat from his forehead, his face is still red]. You have to excuse me... Lately, it's happening more often than usual. So, what do you say?}
{201}{018}{Uh... I can try. But I'd like to hear some details about their quarrel...}
{202}{019}{If there's a reward in it, I will clean the dirty laundry of your family for you.}


{210}{}{I don't know the whole picture, but it seems it's about my son, Daniel. Sam tries to prepare him for the position of leading the town and he is not fine with his mother's... Parenting methods. You know, I don't want to talk about it... Just ask themselves.}
{211}{018}{I have more questions...}
{212}{999}{Okay, I'm out of questions for now. Will try to go and talk to your family.}


{220}{}{Sam used to be a leader here, preceding my father. He is my grandfather - and also one of a few ghouls here in NWO. He is very wise, I consider him not only my relative, but also my friend and teacher. I trust him completely.}
{221}{018}{I have more questions...}
{222}{999}{Okay, I'm out of questions for now. Will try to go and talk to your family.}
{223}{026}{You know, sometimes I have a hard time interacting with dicks who think they are kings of this world because of a different skin color... And I suppose that Sam must have had problems like that on a much larger scale. Maybe you could provide some personal information about him? Like an ace in the hole. It would be easier for me to solve conflict then.}


{230}{}{Lucy... my wife. She is pretty simple at times, yet still manages to surprise me. The one and only champion in sports of getting on the nerves of her husband... Don't take me wrong, I love her very much. I'm just... tired of this conflict. Her main weak spot is our son, Daniel.}
{231}{018}{I have more questions...}
{232}{999}{Okay, I'm out of questions for now. Will try to go and talk to your family.}


{240}{}{[Mark silently looks at you almost for a minute, saying nothing. He probably tries to understand if that's true. Then he suddenly smiles] That's great news! [almost immediately he becomes serious again] It means a lot to me. It may look like some family matters, but it will strongly affect the future of the whole town. I think you deserve a reward... And I have something special here, very rare in our times... Take it. }
{241}{025}{Thank you, Mark. Lucy still asked you to talk to Daniel about his future.}
{242}{999}{Thank you, Mark. I have to go, but I'll come by sometimes.}


{250}{}{Yeah... I think this is what I'm going to do now. Thanks. }
{251}{999}{Bye, Mark.}


{260}{}{I don't think it's a good idea. Frankly speaking, it makes me feel like a traitor... Still, this stuff is beyond any borders now... [He stays silent for some time, probably, weighting choices] ...Okay, listen. Sam is not liked here in the town not only because he is basically walking corpse, who although looks more lively than many. And more smart, for that matter. It's because he also has a lot of pride in him, he won't start apologizing just like that. In case of Lucy - definitely. He takes her for... Narrow-minded chick. }
{261}{027}{How is this of any help to me?}


{270}{}{Wait, I'm not done yet. So, considering that Lucy is also stubborn like a ram, when it comes to arguing, she herself will never take the initiative in peaceful negotiations. Basically, they are both in the waiting for other to crawl down to them with apologies. And, well... To move this somehow, you could... Probably, you could try to persuade Sam with a little fact...}
{271}{028}{Interesting.}


{280}{}{We had the doctor coming through here once, who knew some stuff about ghouls. Name was dr. Spencer, I think. He treated Sam. Didn't tell from what, Sam also kept it a secret. Doctor-patient confidentiality, all that. But Spencer loved good booze. And one time, when he got wasted, he spilled out that Sam has some... Concequenses from his condition. His brains are naturally rotting, decreasing his mental competence and shortening his lifespan. He also told that he prescripted Sam with some antibiotics, rare ones and pretty expensive. I bid my time waiting for chance to talk to Sam about it, offer some help. But couldn't - I know he would refuse my help, he is very prideful. And then we started to notice that amount of batteries in town treasury is decreasing.}
{281}{029}{I think I get it...}


{290}{}{I didn't tell the guards. I didn't tell anyone. I followed him. Of course, it was Sam, quietly stealing the batteries. And he still does. I never confronted him about it. And I would like the situation to change, for him to take all the money he needs, and to no one to know that it's him, who does it. If this leaks out - he will be basically destroyed.}
{291}{030}{Wow... Mark, you're such a pussy.}
{292}{999}{I see. I think that's enough for me, at least for now. I promise not to ruin his reputation. It will stay between us. I'll come back when the matter is settled.}


{300}{}{It would just be better this way. [his face expression looks even more like a stone than usual] And know this, if you'll use this information for harm - everyone in the whole Radius will know that you're the one who stole the batteries and tried to blame Sam for it. Take my word for it. [his looks softens] Now, do you have any questions?}
{301}{018}{Yeah... Would be nice for you to answer in more peaceful way...}
{302}{999}{No. For your information: I didn't plan to ruin his life. The threats were unnecessary. [turn back and leave]}
{303}{999}{No, no questions. [turn back and leave]}


{310}{}{Is that so? What do you want to know?}
{311}{032}{I'm interested in town's history. You have a pretty strong community here. As if all of you are a family...}
{312}{037}{What makes NWO nowadays? How do you survive?}
{313}{038}{Tell me about local residents. At least about the ones worth talking to, from your point of view. }
{314}{102}{You know, I'm interested in something called the encyclopedia. I've heard of it a lot. Would like to study it. There was some rumors you know more than anyone about the matter.}
{315}{999}{You know, I've just remembered I have some things to do... I'll come by later!}


{320}{}{[he pulls back, strangely staring at you] So... If you want me to make comments on the rumors about the first leader's death, I have nothing. No one does. Everyone babble all kind of nonsense... The testaments are also blank on the matter.}
{321}{033}{The first leader?}
{322}{035}{The testaments?}
{323}{031}{Actually, I'm not talking about that. Let's get back to questions about the town...}
{324}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{330}{}{[he bites his lip] Oh, you didn't know... I was talking about Jim Reynolds. Judging by the testaments, he was a bad leader and not a good man either. He was removed from his position, the leader's status transferred to a more... adequate person. And about the rumors... You'll come by them eventually, If you still didn't. So it's better to hear from me, I suppose. The talk was that people beat him to death, minced him into mash, put it into tin cans and then ritually ate. Some kind of bullshit.}
{331}{034}{Oh wow... You guys are scary...}
{332}{035}{What testaments did you mention?}
{333}{999}{You know, I've just remembered I have some things to do... I'll come by later...}


{340}{}{Scary? I tell you - this is all bullshit talk. Let's get back to you questio- [he suddenly gnarles forward, coughing. After a minute, he continues] -questions about the town.}
{341}{035}{Wait, I wanted to ask about the testaments... What is it anyway?}
{342}{031}{I still have a couple of questions...}
{343}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{350}{}{Testaments... I guess it sounds too pompous, when you say it. It's something akin to a set of rules, which the first leader left to his successors to follow. Actually, they are quite smart. Although, don't confuse them with the laws... And no one knows them well enough, except the town leaders.}
{351}{036}{So you follow them?}
{352}{031}{Let's get back to questions about you town...}
{353}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{360}{}{It should be none of your concern.}
{361}{031}{Okay, let's get back to questions about you town...}
{362}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{370}{}{We feed the whole Radius. Everyone would be long dead, if not for us. Well, most of them. Or they would have had to learn to feed on sunlight, wind and holy spirit. All in all, we are in a pretty good position here. We trade with everyone and live here as one big "family".}
{371}{031}{I see. A couple more questions...}
{372}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{380}{}{Everyone is equal to me here, I can't say someone stands out much. Maybe you'll ask more specific question? Who do you want to know about?}
{381}{041}{Burns}
{382}{042}{Daniel}
{383}{044}{Dan}
{384}{047}{Arsene}
{385}{048}{Maurissa}
{386}{049}{Juan}
{387}{039}{[next]}
{388}{031}{I guess I'd like to go back to questions about the town.}
{389}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{390}{}{Everyone is equal to me here, I can't say someone stands out much. Maybe you'll ask more specific question? Who do you want to know about?}
{391}{050}{Cyren}
{392}{053}{Hinder}
{393}{054}{Philipp}
{394}{055}{Seth}
{395}{055}{Matt}
{396}{040}{[next]}
{397}{038}{[previous]}
{398}{031}{I guess I'd like to go back to questions about the town.}
{399}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{400}{}{Everyone is equal to me here, I can't say someone stands out much. Maybe you'll ask more specific question? Who do you want to know about?}
{401}{056}{Flint}
{402}{057}{Owen}
{403}{058}{Skeet}
{404}{059}{Blanca}
{405}{060}{I'm actually interested in hearing about you.}
{406}{038}{[first page]}
{407}{039}{[second page]}
{408}{031}{I guess I'd like to go back to questions about the town.}
{409}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{410}{}{Burns... He is a good man, despite having manners more suitable to a lavash corral janitor, than to the head of guards. But I'm fully confident with him. He is ready to do anything to keep us and our home safe. A piece of advice for you: do not talk to him about women - he will tire you with his success-stories, filled with a lot more toilet humor than his usual conversations...}
{411}{038}{[ask about someone else]}
{412}{031}{A valuable advice... but I'd like to go back to questions about the town.}
{413}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{420}{}{Daniel... My joy, my sadness. He is so young and juvenile. He can get back at you in a really nasty tone, or to say something stupid - not because he really thinks so, but because he finds it "cool-looking". I know my ways towards every member of our community, excluding my own son. I don't even think I'm familiar with him well enough...}
{421}{043}{Listen, Mark, do you even spend time together? Did you talk to him about the future?}
{422}{038}{I see - you don't like to talk about this. I'll ask about other ones in NWO now, okay?}
{423}{031}{I see - you don't like to talk about this. I'd like to get back to questions about the town.}
{424}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{430}{}{[Mark gives you a long, tired look, saying nothing. Looks like he waits for you to change the subject.]}
{431}{038}{Oh... sorry. Let's talk about other ones in NWO, okay?}
{432}{031}{I'd like to get back to questions about the town.}
{433}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{440}{}{Dan? Rude, harsh and sneaky. Burns used to notice him doing little mean things a couple of times. A petty crook, in my view. }
{441}{045}{Why won't you throw him out then?}
{442}{038}{I don't think he's of interest to me. Let's talk about someone else?}
{443}{031}{Yeah... Let's get back to questions about town.}
{444}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{450}{}{If you still don't get it, we are all family here. You can't just throw someone out. I serve my town not by being paranoid about its inhabitants, or something. I have neither power, nor inclination to do so.}
{451}{046}{I could do a little surveillance on him.}
{452}{038}{I see. Would you mind telling me about the others in NWO?}
{453}{031}{Okay. Then i'd like to knowe something else about the town.}
{454}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{460}{}{Drop it. We are not talking about this.}
{461}{038}{Okay, okay! Relax, Mark, let's talk about something else.}
{462}{031}{Fine then, back to questions about the town.}
{463}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{470}{}{Arsene? Good for nothing mess without his own opinion. My son's buddy. Can't say I'm delighted to interact with him. He has a very cluttered mind.}
{471}{038}{Looks like I'll hardly get any value from communicating with him... let's talk about someone else?}
{472}{031}{Yeah... Let's get back to questions about the town.}
{473}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{480}{}{I kindly ask you to not mock her. She is the strange one, very strange. But that does not make her a bad person. Have some compassion to her obsessive ideas. You can even agree with her, but I dare you to do anything she asks about - be safer. And way less stupidly looking...}
{481}{038}{I like your town more with every minute... how did you manage not to kill off each other by now? Would you mind telling me more about such wackos?}
{482}{031}{Such a madhouse. Let's get back to questions about the town.}
{483}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{490}{}{He is an incredible man. A master of his craft and strong link in the chain of our community. A pity he doesn't have kids. Only I wouldn't recommend you to ask him to teach you something. But if you are suffering from insomnia, he's the man for the job. He can put to sleep even the ones who just got up from a night full of dreams.}
{491}{038}{You have such a dream team here. Mind me asking about someone else?}
{492}{031}{I still have some questions about the town...}
{493}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{500}{}{Our scout. The man of steel nerves and infinite courage. He's an important part of our society. Wish we had more ones like him...}
{501}{051}{Maybe I'll upset you, but your heroic scout is actually a coward. I accompanied him to Tin Industries at his request - he told me that his previous partner "has perished". In reality, he left his partner to die as a burden. And he also did the same to me. I advise you to look carefully at this loser - at least don't give him any partners.}
{502}{038}{Okay... I'm interested in someone else...}
{503}{031}{I see... Let's get back to questions about the town.}
{504}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{510}{}{[Mark froze, like he just stepped into shit] What?}
{511}{052}{I am saying that your hero is a gutless puppy who runs away with tail between his legs at first chance he gets.}


{520}{}{I see... You know, I have to ask you not to talk wide about the matter... This could lead only to lynching from the town's folk. I'll talk to him myself. He will pay fully to the community, believe me. And... Thank you, not only for getting tin from Tin Industries, but also for telling me everything about this... Here, take it. It's well-deserved.}
{521}{038}{Thanks, Mark, glad to be of help, you know. Would you tell me more about someone else?}
{522}{031}{Thanks, Mark. Let's get back to questions about the town.}
{523}{999}{Thanks, Mark. By the way, I gotta go. I'll come by.}


{530}{}{Our doctor. Has hands of gold. I don't recommend bothering him with stupid questions. The talk is, once he had a patient who wouldn't shut up. So, instead of painkillers, he injected the poor guy with some stuff, which caused itches wor a whole week straight. That idiot got himself fully cut and scratched. And a cherry on the cake - in the end his eyebrows fell off.}
{531}{038}{I'll keep that in mind... I'm interested in someone else.}
{532}{031}{I'll keep that in mind... Let's get back to questions about the town.}
{533}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{540}{}{He's the only one I can't talk much about. I had no interactions with him. }
{541}{038}{Okay, then I have some questions about other inhabitants.}
{542}{031}{I see... Let's get back to questions about the town then.}
{543}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{550}{}{Seth and Matt. They are brothers, although often treat each other worse than anybody around them. I suppose it's the usual thing - we don't appreciate what we have. Anyway, they are good guys.}
{551}{038}{As you say, but in my opinion these two are not right in their heads. Let's talk about someone else.}
{552}{031}{Good guys, but strange... Let's get back to the questions about town.}
{553}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{560}{}{Oh... He's our hereditary caravaneer. Keep him away from your booze if you have some, and take lightly everything he says about himself.}
{561}{038}{Okay, then I have some questions about other inhabitants.}
{562}{031}{I see... Let's get back to questions about the town then.}
{563}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{570}{}{He's one of our best butchers. As long as I can remember - never met anyone else who can be so enthusiastic about dismembering the lavash. He is doing it so precise it's scary and beautiful at the same time. Especially considering that you can't always say if he's serious, or fooling around...}
{571}{038}{Okay, then I have some questions about other inhabitants.}
{572}{031}{I see... Let's get back to questions about the town then.}
{573}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{5801}{}{Skeet... You know, I don't want to talk about him. I trusted the man - and turns out he has been stealing our canned meat from storage... Let's talk about something else.}
{581}{038}{Okay, then I have some questions about other inhabitants.}
{582}{031}{I see... Let's get back to questions about the town then.}
{583}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}
{5802}{}{Um... By the way, thank you, for clearing out the Skeet's reputation... You know, I've been accusing him too, in stealing. So I suppose you know him better than me, and I have nothing new to say.}
{584}{038}{Okay, then let's get back to questions about the town's inhabitants.}
{585}{031}{I'd like to ask about the town.}
{586}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{590}{}{Blanca? She's young and not very smart. Quite fond of our scout, Cyren. Nothing more to say about her...}
{591}{038}{Okay, then I have some questions about other inhabitants.}
{592}{031}{I see... Let's get back to questions about the town then.}
{593}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{600}{}{About me? [he ponders for a while, then coughs and scratches his chin] I am the leader of this town; I've been prepared for this position since my childhood: I was forced to learn a lot. I also had to spend a lot of time in factory bays, watching workers. How they do they labor from day to day, wearing out their backs for the good of our society. Now my conscience doesn't allow me to just sit here doing nothing, making myself a local god to worship.}
{601}{061}{As far as I see, your son was left out of this kind of upbringing?}
{602}{038}{Okay, then I have some questions about other inhabitants.}
{603}{031}{I see... Let's get back to questions about the town then.}
{604}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{610}{}{[Mark gets silent for a moment] Yes. Lucy strongly objected to such parenting methods. Maybe it would be better not to listen to her opinion in such matters, then he would have grown up a fine man. Let's change the subject, okay?}
{611}{038}{Okay, then I have some questions about other inhabitants.}
{612}{031}{Sure, Mark... Let's get back to questions about the town then.}
{613}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{620}{}{Yes?}
{621}{063}{I spoke to Burns... He told me that you have some kind of problem regarding your successor. He didn't get much into details, only said it would be better to discuss it with you.}
{622}{073}{Mark, I talked to everyone, just as you asked.}
{623}{072}{I'm still in the process of doing my job. Just came by.}
{624}{097}{About Sam's election...}
{625}{098}{About talking some sense into your son...}
{626}{999}{Uh... Mark, I need to run now, have some stuff to take care of...}


{6301}{}{I wonder why someone who has nothing to do with my problems just comes around and offers to help?}
{631}{064}{Well, uh... I like politics and currency, you know. Hey, relax! I'll make my benefit. Pretty sure that there's a reward for helping in the main town matters, am I right?}
{632}{064}{Because I want to make a life better. I meant my life, of course. Is there a reward?}
{633}{065}{I had a really good talk with Burns. And I've seen how you all live here. Just want to help. Honestly.}
{6302}{}{Glad to see you. Yeah, your help might come in handy...}
{635}{066}{[listen]}


{640}{}{[Mark carefully studies your face. It takes a really long time. Seems like he is torn between the urge to throw you out and being completely powerless in his situation] Yes. If you can be of any value. So...}
{641}{066}{[listen]}


{650}{}{I somehow hardly believe you. But what do I lose? Okay then...}
{651}{066}{[listen]}


{660}{}{Are you already acquantained with my son Daniel?}
{661}{067}{Yes}
{662}{071}{No}
{663}{071}{No [lie]}
{664}{067}{Yes [lie]}


{670}{}{And what do you think about him?}
{671}{068}{He's okay.}
{672}{068}{He's... kind of stupid.}
{673}{068}{I wouldn't trust him with cleaning the toilet, let alone managing the town...}
{674}{068}{Still don't have an opinion.}


{680}{}{[Mark is silent. Probably thinks about what to say] Ah, well, doesn't matter. It's not about him.}
{681}{069}{[listen]}


{690}{}{The thing is that lately I feel... shitty. Doc says I don't have much time left. So, I need to present a new future leader to the community. According to tradition, it should be my son, but... Let's put it like this - I don't think he is ready. And more so - I don't think he is capable of leading the community to better future, instead he's more likely to put an end to everything we achieved here. You will understand me better when you'll talk to him.}
{691}{070}{So what is needed from me?}


{700}{}{You have a fresh eye. Talk to Daniel, try to assess what's going on in his head. Maybe there's also some point in talking about Daniel with Burns first. Or maybe to his friend, Arsene. And talk to Sam, he's his grandfather and spends much more time with him. Do not talk to Lucy though. She'll try to put things in a better light, stuff like that. We don't need it. Get back to me when you'll find out what's what.}
{701}{999}{Okay. Be right back.}


{710}{}{He is my 20-year old son. And if you want to be of any help, you'll have to meet him...}
{711}{069}{[listen]}


{720}{}{When you're done, meet me here.}
{721}{999}{Okay.}


{730}{}{It's great. So how is it?}
{731}{074}{Mark, I wouldn't say "it's great". I have a pretty bad news for you. Uh... You might want to sit, maybe... Because your son... Is not quite your son.}
{732}{095}{Mark, he is a mess. Maybe this is none of my business, but... I think he is not ready.}


{740}{}{What? [he doesn't move and just stares at you]}
{741}{075}{He is Lucy's son, alright. But not from you. That's how it is.}


{750}{}{[Mark breath becomes very heavy, he sits down, covering his face]}
{751}{076}{[wait silently]}
{752}{094}{Mark... Are you alright?}
{753}{094}{Mark... You ain't helping the situation. The problem needs to be solved.}


{760}{}{Okay. Okay... About Lucy... I will deal with her later. As for now... I need to put an end to this successor thing... I can't die without managing the situation. I have no right to do so!}
{761}{077}{[listen silently]}


{7701}{}{I think I have an idea about what to do. While you've been busy helping our town, I did some research. And all of my people have very good opinion about you. So, here's the thing - are you ready to lead the NWO?}
{771}{078}{Oh wow... Mark, it is a huge honor for me. But - how? Don't you inherit the leader position by birth?}
{772}{086}{That would be, uh... A very generous proposition... But think - what kind of leader am I? I have many things to do outside of NWO. I won't be here often... All in all, I don't think I'm the best option for this job.}
{773}{093}{Me? Sure! Are there girls and booze attached to it?}
{7702}{}{I think I have an idea about what to do. I suppose my people will not be very happy about it, but I'm out of other options. Sam... He was a leader here once. He knows how to run the town. He is willing to sacrifice himself for the needs of NWO's people. But he can't be put into leader's position just like this. [Mark stares at you - probably awaiting for some reaction]}
{774}{092}{Let me guess. I'm gonna help?}
{775}{088}{And?}
{776}{088}{But what's the problem? Can't you just put him in or put him out?}


{780}{}{Yeah. By the right of birth, exactly that. Still, I have no heirs after all that happened. But I still can adopt, right? I can adopt you and make you my successor. The town people will be glad, considering their attitude about you and Daniel. So... What do you say?}
{781}{079}{That is quite sudden, I must say... Probably could work... Yeah, this is a great idea!}
{782}{079}{Yes. I accept.}
{783}{086}{But what I would do on this position? I mean... I'd have to deal with everything you deal with... And I know jack shit about anything of it.}
{784}{087}{That is... Actually, very kind of you. But... I think, that for your society would be better if the leader position would be taken by someone else. Sam, for example. He has been a leader, right? He is experienced...}


{790}{}{Very good. I'm glad about your decision. I have to brief you about activities, do the adoption part and so on. There's a lot of work to do, but now I also have one problem less... So - I'd like you to ask all your questions of interest right now.}
{791}{080}{[continue]}


{800}{}{[Mark still watches you with studying look. It seems like he already assessed every wrinkle and pore on your face.]}
{801}{081}{What responsibilities would I carry? You've been preparing for this since childhood... I, on the other hand, know nothing about how you do things here...}
{802}{082}{When should I start? }
{803}{083}{About the adoption... How one does it, anyway?}
{804}{084}{I see. In general, I have no more questions. Maybe you want to say some words of encouragement?}


{810}{}{Hmm... You'll manage. Sam and Burns will be there for you with their advices, if you need them. Generally, the leader defines external and internal politics, starting from dividing the revenue and supplies, and all the way to the war duties and trade activities. The responsibility is pretty big, but don't be afraid - I'm not goiing to cemetery so soon. So I will provide help as long as I can, slowly introducing you into our key matters. Anyway, everyone else will already consider you as a leader. I need a couple more days to finish some preparations and announce my successor. Don't be surprised if people will suddenly start to pester you with their requests.}
{811}{080}{Okay, I understood that part. Still, I have some questions...}
{812}{084}{I see. In general, I have no more questions. Maybe you want to say some words of encouragement?}


{820}{}{You won't have to deal with town businesses right away. First I will fill you in details. So, for some time you will be more like playing a role of a symbol of new beginning for NWO. With the teaching part we will deal later, I'll keep you posted. It should happen right after I will finish with my wife and... Son.}
{821}{080}{Okay, I understood that part. Still, I have some questions...}
{822}{084}{I see. In general, I have no more questions. Maybe you want to say some words of encouragement?}


{830}{}{Oh, it's nothing difficult. I'll do everything myself, it's just a few formalities. If it wasn't about putting you in a leader's seat, we would've just told the people and were done with it.}
{831}{080}{Okay, I understood that part. Still, I have some questions...}
{832}{084}{I see. In general, I have no more questions. Maybe you want to say some words of encouragement?}


{840}{}{Words? [Mark smiles for a brief moment] You will get so many of them from me that you'll be tired... But I have something better. [he puts out and hands to you what seems to be a very old book. It is covered with thick layer of dirt and loads of patches]. This is one of the most important things in NWO. A collection of every leader's notes... Also known as the encyclopedia. As you are now a leader of NWO, I suggest you to take a look into it. In any case, you will be responsible for its safety and actuality.}
{841}{085}{Thanks, Mark. }


{850}{}{[he nods] Now, I have a lot of work to do. Come around in a few days. We'll talk.}
{851}{999}{Okay. Bye, Mark.}


{860}{}{Make a decision first. Do you really think I would make such an offer if I wasn't sure you'll handle it?}
{861}{079}{Yes... Yes, okay. I accept!}
{862}{087}{That is... Actually, very kind of you. But... I think, that for your society would be better if the leader position would be taken by someone else. Sam, for example. He has been a leader, right? He is experienced...}


{870}{}{[Mark starts to think. He put his hand on a chin, scratching it]. Sam... Yeah. I mostly agree with you, but his reputation in this town is... not very good. I'm going to need some help with this.}
{871}{088}{Sure, no problem, Mark. What kind of help are we talking about?}
{872}{088}{As if it could be anything else... Okay, what help?}


{880}{}{Do you know what elections is? [Mark throws a quick look at you and goes on, making the question rhetorical] That's when people of the community choose their leader from a set of candidates. And we actually don't have elections here. The position is inherited, like under the monarchy. Still, to stay in the lead you need to not only be selfless manager, ready to make sacrifice in the name of community. You also need the people to know about your good deeds and future plans for the town. And, most importantly, they should like you. Sounds pretty strange, but that's how it is.}
{881}{089}{Uhhhh - soooo?}


{890}{}{To participate in elections you need to set up an election campaign. Basically, that's where the candidate tells everyone how great he is. So - the people here must be reminded about Sam's good deeds - and persuaded that his brains are not completely rotten. That he will make for a great leader.}
{891}{090}{And how the hell do you think I'm going to do that?}


{900}{}{I would be seen as biased, if I'd start delivering speeches about Sam. And it shouldn't look like I'm imposing my opinion. I think it's generally bad idea to say "let's put Sam in leader's shoes". The message should be more subtle. Try to make it look like people made this decision themselves.}
{901}{091}{Should I talk to every resident here? Really?}


{910}{}{No, not to everyone. Only to the ones that folk listens to. Talk to Juan, Cyren, Flint, Owen, Burns and Hinder.}
{911}{999}{Well... Okay. I'll try to do something with it. Will be back when Sam's reputation is equal to one of the saints, or something.}

{920}{}{One more thing, if you are worried about the reward - there will be, once you're done with this. }
{921}{088}{Well... Okay. Tell me, what can I do.}


{930}{}{Still joking around? Tell me straight - yes or no.}
{931}{078}{Yes. But I still don't het it - you have inheritance of leader position here, right?}
{932}{087}{Sounds really promising, yes... but I don't think this is where I should belong. It's like dressing me as a stripper and putting me on the pole. Why don't you... Why don't you put Sam on this position?}


{940}{}{I-... Ye-... Hold on a second...}
{941}{076}{[wait for Mark to calm down]}


{950}{}{Ohh... As sad as it is - everyone thinks that. But he is young! A wind in the head. I am sure he will become wiser with time.}
{951}{096}{But still. He seriously thinks that when put in leader's position, he'll conquer the whole Radius. He is ready to starve your neighboring communities to death. I don't think he can be dissuaded.}


{960}{}{Listen... Talk to him. Dig a little deeper. I'm sure he is not completely lost. Please.}
{961}{999}{As you say, Mark. But I'm starting to get tired from all the hassle with your relatives... [leave]}
{962}{999}{Ugh, yeah. [turn around and walk away]}
{963}{999}{[Sigh, grin, nod your head and go away]}


{970}{}{Yes?}
{971}{099}{Those who you pointed on are ready to support Sam. But they warned me that there will be a lot of dissatisfied with the decision.}


{980}{}{Yes?}
{981}{074}{Mark, I have a pretty bad news for you. Uh... You might want to sit, maybe... Because your son... Is not quite your son.}
{982}{100}{I would really want to tell you that it's all good... But your son is absolutely not ready for this. More so, he pretended to care about your demise and tried to act like he's ready to learn when put in power. Long story short, he just waits for you to kick the bucket.}
{983}{101}{Daniel promised me to become more sensible. He told me he didn't know that it would be so soon for him to fill this position. He is ready to learn.}


{990}{}{Good. I already spoke to him. It's going to be a hard time, so I have another request. [he puts out and hands to you what seems to be a very old book. It is covered with thick layer of dirt and loads of patches] This is called the encyclopedia. Probably in the future it may be basis for writing a history. It was passed from one leader to another. I'm afraid it can be lost because of the problems with successing. So I ask you to keep it. Return it when there's a better situation here. And, of course, here's the reward... [Mark gives you a small bag of batteries]. I've got a lot of work to do, so excuse me. And thank you for everything.}
{991}{999}{Bye, Mark. Good luck.}


{1000}{}{Damn... I am so tired of it. Okay... Looks like... Looks like I have no other choice... So it's Sam. Sam is the only one who can lead the town...}
{1001}{088}{[keep listening]}


{1010}{}{That's... That's wonderful! Even better than I expected! [Mark smiles, but looks like he is staring into emptiness] This looks very promising. [he focuses on you] But there will definitely be problems... It's going to be a hard time, so I have another request. [he puts out and hands to you what seems to be a very old book. It is covered with thick layer of dirt and loads of patches] This is called the encyclopedia. Probably in the future it may be basis for writing a history. It was passed from one leader to another. I'm afraid it would be lost, because no matter what my son says - he is not very reliable. So I ask you to keep it. Return it when there's a better situation here. And, of course, here's the reward... [Mark gives you a small bag of batteries]. I've got a lot of work to do, so excuse me. And thank you for everything.}
{1011}{999}{Bye, Mark. Good luck.}


{1020}{}{Yes. I know everything about it - I am its current keeper. The encyclopedia shall not be issued. And access to it can be given only to those NWO's residents who has proven their loyalty and good will to the community. It contains knowledge and expertise of all NWO's leaders. Make something of yourself here and we will talk about it.}
{1021}{031}{I see... Then I have a couple of other questions.}


{1030}{}{Yes, everything is quite alright. You know, a lot of work, as usual. Seems like it never ends...}
{1031}{104}{How's Daniel doing?}
{1032}{105}{How is Sam?}
{1033}{106}{When should I start fulfilling my role as a leader?}
{1034}{107}{How are you? How is your condition?}
{1035}{999}{Okay. I see you are pretty busy... So long then. I'll come by.}


{1040}{}{Studying, just as he promised. There are some rumors going that he still hangs out with Arsene, although I forbade it. But while everything looks so good - I prefer not to touch this topic very often.}
{1041}{107}{And what about you? Think you can handle tutoring him before your time comes?}
{1042}{999}{Okay. I see you are pretty busy... So long then. I'll come by.}


{1050}{}{The folks are not happy, some are just spit out the poison... They say that "all that's left is for Mark to become a ghoul, then he and Sam could rule here forever, changing places over time, until other people die out..." [he sighs]. So upsetting to hear that after all I gave to this town. I hope this is temporary. Our people are conservative. What else could be done here?}
{1051}{107}{What about you? Does this malicious talk have any effect on you? It's not going to put you into an early grave, is it?}
{1052}{999}{I see. Be strong. I'll come by later.}


{1060}{}{I don't know yet. I have some problems to solve, when I'm done - I'll let you know. For your own safety, do not talk much about you being leader of this community outside of this place. It could lead to some consequenses, for example - prevent you from acquiring some good trade deals; or it could even lead to some robbers being more interested in your person than usual. And one more thing: I announced you as my successor to some of our people. Don't be surprised if they will suddenly start to pester you with requests..}
{1061}{107}{Okay, but what about you? This amout of work is not going to put you into an early grave, is it?}
{1062}{999}{Okay. I see you are pretty busy... So long then. I'll come by.}


{1070}{}{I'm good. Still going. Walking by myself, not being fed with a spoon. No nanny is put to watch me.}
{1071}{999}{Okay. I see you are pretty busy... So long then. I'll come by.}

{1080}{}{Skeet? That thief of our canned food? And what do you want to tell me about him?}
{1081}{109}{He had nothing to do with stealing! The canned food has been eaten by an old Chimera. I killed it.}
{1082}{999}{Nothing... Except I think he is innocent here. I will find a way to prove it.}
{1083}{}{Well, that fits. Our watchmen really detected an old Chimera in our warehouse. It's so good that no one got hurt... As for Skeet - of course we'll release him. And... Yeah, we owe him an apology.}
{1084}{999}{Great. Glad that justice was served.}

{1090}{}{So it's true. Amazing! When I was told about that dead Chimera - I couldn't believe it. And turns out it's you who killed it! It's so good that no one got hurt. You did a big favor to us! As for Skeet - of course we'll release him. And... Yeah, we owe him an apology.}
{1091}{109}{Great. Glad that justice was served.}

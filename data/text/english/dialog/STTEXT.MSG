#First Visit on a map

{300}{}{}
{301}{}{The same technicians roam the parking lot in search of the same spare parts.}
{302}{}{The warm hands of your mother wake you up.}
{303}{}{So many years have passed, but almost nothing has changed in Tartarus.}
{304}{}{After another 4 years, still nothing has changed.}
{305}{}{The Farms of Tartarus... The humid air is saturated with the smell of rotten corn and the shit of the Lavash.}
{306}{}{It seems that with each new visit to the Farm the air here becomes even more disgusting than before...}
{307}{}{The Maintenance Level. Continuous noise of water pumping and purification units will never let you fall asleep here.}
{308}{}{The stench from the Mouth of Hades immediately hits you in the nose and almost knocks you to the ground.}
{309}{}{This is the Purgatory. In the pitch darkness, you can smell fear and death.}
{310}{}{Unbearably bright sunlight hits your eyes, you start to choke, but soon your senses are clear again.}
{3010}{}{I need to check this box, see if there's anything interesting there.}
{311}{}{An old parking lot with piles of twisted metal. As a child, you loved to play here so much.}
{312}{}{The old metro line ends with a blockage, but you can see a turn to the right.}
{313}{}{An old Olympus Station. Dim lights illuminate the frail bodies of the local inhabitants.}
{314}{}{Apparently, here's where used to be the waiting rooms and administration cabinet of the Olympus Station.}
{315}{}{Among the remains of houses you can see a passage into the underground.}
{316}{}{As everywhere else, devastation and destuction reign supreme.}
{317}{}{You clearly sense the smell of rotting meat in the old damp basement.}
{318}{}{This is quite a bustling and busy place, guarded by armed men. Looks like there's a lot of trading going on.}
{319}{}{It looks like the Headquarters of the Sunset Jackals. The building is heavily guarded.}
{320}{}{This place reminds you of the old Tartarus parking lot. The raiders seem to dig around the old trash in search of needed scrap.}
{321}{}{It's surprisingly lively here, with a lot of raiders sleeping or wandering around. A good half of them gathered around the ring, shouting something.}
{322}{}{There aren't many people here, but they're all well-armed. Apparently, that building is an old warehouse.}
{323}{}{This place doesn't look like other buildings, and no one seems to have been here for a long time. You have a bad feeling about it.}
{324}{}{A basement room that looks more like an old army bunker for case of a nuclear attack.}
{325}{}{On the opposite side of the plateau, you can see the entrance to a cave.}
{326}{}{It's dark and damp, but it looks like someone made a shelter here.}
{327}{}{This place is a busy shopping area. The sweet spirit of open market relations feels in the air.}
{328}{}{The smell of machine oil and raw meat, mixed with ooze of feces and aroma of sweat from hard laboring workers, hits your nose right at the doorway. This is a factory floor.}
{329}{}{...Another 4 years. You are already 21, but nothing has changed in Tartarus.}
{330}{}{EXTRA MAP}
{331}{}{Here and there you see residential tents and dilapidated houses. The ambience is filled with the constant lowing of Lavash and buzzing of flies.}
{332}{}{A huge "LIVOS" sign in big, richly decorated letters, points to the entrance of the cave, near which travelers and merchants jostle.}
{333}{}{The cave arches are merging with concrete walls, in front of which you see an automatic turret. It immediately locks onto you.}
{334}{}{The staircase leads you to a network of rooms and corridors. Richly dressed vault dwellers are roaming back and forth.}
{335}{}{In the poorly lit space of rooms stand incomprehensible machines and devices. Looks like it's some kind of technical area.}
{336}{}{It is quite dark and humid here. You can hear the splashing sounds of water nearby, the hum of machinery, and some... Grunting?}
{337}{}{The stale, heavy air immediately takes your breath away. You slowly calm down and let your eyes adjust to the impenetrable darkness.}
{338}{}{This place looks like the encampment of some raiders or vagabonds. Some of the locals are dead drunk or are moaning from hunger, others constantly seem to look for something.}
{339}{}{In this part the settlement looks more vibrant, and it seems that the excitement is associated with a nearby fenced-in square.}
{340}{}{This is it, your first fight in the Arena! You need to make best use of your skills in melee combat and win!}
{341}{}{The room turned out to be a real hangout, with alcohol, blackjack and whores! The drunken men tap out a melody with their feet and fists, setting the rhythm to the dancers.}
{342}{}{The long corridor seems to end in darkness. You're willing to bet that it's been a long time since someone has set foot here.}
{343}{}{At the entrance to the cave you see bored guards. Probably, they stand there because they are guarding that cave's entrance.}
{344}{}{In a small passageway ahead, you see a couple of burly savages, waving at you.}
{345}{}{Looks like the settlement is securely sheltered from every direction. You would feel quite at home - if it weren't for that sweet taste in the air...}
{346}{}{In the pitch darkness of the cave you can't see anything. You can only hear sounds. And the sounds you hear don't promise a pleasant stroll.}
{347}{}{To your surprise, you stumble upon a huge mansion hidden between the cliffs! Surely, its former owner must have been very rich - and not very hospitable.}
{348}{}{In the middle of the wasteland stands a lonely shabby hut. A very, very suspicious hut.}
{349}{}{Almost falling off the last step, you find yourself in a stuffy room, soaked through with sweat and alcohol.}
{350}{}{In front of you lies the main entrance to a fairly large factory, very similar to the one in NWO. Or maybe all factories look the same to you.}
{351}{}{The air inside of this workshop is filled with a smell of rotten rags. Around you see scattered evidence of current tenants's presence.}
{352}{}{You hear a strange rustling in the basement. It's like someone's scratching stones with a nail.}
{353}{}{There are only mountains around, nothing except mountains...}
{354}{}{The "Miracle City" that appears before you looks quite disappointing. Only a few walls, mold and pale cave mushrooms are left here.}
{355}{}{Rising high into the sky, before you stands the huge skyscraper of Olympus. Menacing Defenders, standing next to the tower, look very insignificant in comparison.}
{356}{}{The beauty of the interior furnishings makes your jaw drop on the floor and lay there for some time.}
{357}{}{Men and women in coats, that may have been white a long time ago, are scurrying back and forth with flasks and fancy instruments.}
{358}{}{It's hard to figure out what's going on here, but there are even more people in white coats than on the previous floor.}
{359}{}{The local staff is running from terminal to terminal with bulging eyes and disheveled hair. They must be busy with something very important and urgent.}
{360}{}{The fresh, warm air hits you in the face, and the view takes your breath away.}
{361}{}{This place looks like a high-tech lab. The white coats around again, but not as much fuss like at the engineering level.}
{362}{}{The Abode of the Defenders, no other way to call it. You feel like a dwarf next to these mighty warriors.}
{363}{}{The hum of the transformers here is incredibly loud, and the air is so electrified that you can feel the hair all over your body standing.}
{364}{}{There is absolutely nothing in this room except the elevator and a HUGE door with a code panel.}
{365}{}{You boldly take a step forward...}
{366}{}{A surprisingly dense thicket. It's like a suburban forest park or something. But you are sure that the scorpions will find you.}
{367}{}{You can see paths in the desert, but they are too wide to be trodden by people.}
{368}{}{In the mountain you can see a nicely decorated entrance to the caves, from where you can hear a low rumbling sound.}
{369}{}{The closer you get, the more dizzy and aching your head becomes. There's clearly something wrong with this place!}
{370}{}{All around is just desert and wasteland.}

#TALK ABOUT THE RENAISSANCE
#
{910}{1}{Renaissance, you say? Yes, there are a lot of rumors about this place. Even the last ghoul in the Radius heard that there is a promising RENAISSANCE somewhere nearby, where it is warm, quiet, calm, plenty of food and water... Everyone knows this place exists, but hell, no one, absolutely no one, knows where it is.}
{911}{}{I see. Thanks for the information.}
{912}{2}{Renaissance... [grins] Yeah, man, there is such a place, nice and warm. I know a lot of people have been looking for it. They even say someone has found it, but no one has ever seen this "someone" since. I mean, there was one kid who'd been to the Renaissance, but I don't know what happened to him.}
{913}{}{If somebody was there, then this place really exists. Thanks for that, too.}
{914}{3}{Ah, so that's what you're up to! There was one just like you - just as inquisitive. But now he is not [chuckles]. The Renaissance is a locked-down secret governmental city. Probably, some presidents or monarchs live there. And people like you will be shot from half a mile on the way to this Renaissance of yours! Mark my words, stop looking for him, or you'll end up badly.}
{915}{}{Yeah, that sounds dangerous... I guess I need to be more careful.}
{916}{4}{The city of Eden, yeah... [rolls his eyes] They say it has smart vending machines that give out delicious food, provide light and heat... But, and I know for a fact, this place is very well hidden somewhere in the mountains. It's even surrounded by something that clouds your thoughts. You may not believe it, but a lot of people were looking for it and never came back! There was, however, one boy, who did. And he not only returned but also drew a map of how to find this place. The rumor goes like he divided this map into 4 parts and hid it in different corners of the Radius... Who knows if any of that is true. Maybe there's no such place as Renaissance, after all?}
{917}{}{A map? With a map, it would be much easier to find it. Of course, if the Renaissance really exists...}
{918}{}{There's not much I can tell you. It seems that there is something somewhere, but no one knows where and what.}
{919}{}{Renaissance, Paradise City, Heaven... [winks] I think it's like normal heaven - it doesn't exist.}
{920}{}{There are many rumors, but no one knows anything specific.}
{921}{}{Yes, people say different things, so you can choose what to believe and what not...}
{922}{}{I see.}
{923}{}{Okay, I see.}
{924}{}{Well, of course, yes.}

{930}{}{Herald? I... Me? Yes, yes, of course, I'm already going to do my work! Excuse me.}
{931}{}{What? No, no, I'm... Just looking for tools. Of course, I will work for the good of the Gods.}
{932}{}{Yes, of course, just as the Gods say!}
{933}{}{Warden? I do everything I'm told.}
{934}{}{I'm... It's just... I'm on my way to work, I have to go.}
{935}{}{I don't complain, no! Everything is good, I like to serve the Gods.}
#Kids
{936}{}{Herald! Tell me about the Gods!}
{937}{}{Is it true that there are terrible creatures outside?}
{938}{}{Mom says this is where we belong. And where is the place for the Gods, Herald?}
{940}{}{Uuuh, Warden! What cool armor!}
{941}{}{Warden, can I touch the armor? At least a little bit?}
{942}{}{[stands at attention] Reporting! No horrible creatures have been seen under the bed!}
#Security guards
{943}{}{Herald? Why aren't you on duty?}

{947}{}{Hey, big military guy, you're bothering me. I'm on duty.}
{948}{}{You would be more useful in patrolling the outside perimeters.}

#Critter text file << Livos resident guy in the filtration room >> 
#############################################################
#File structure:
#lines 1-9 - description of the character;
#lines 10-29 - acquaintance with a pesonage;
#lines 30-99 - I don't know yet, but I think it will be useful...
#Next, on the branches of the dialogue.
#Each branch is a multiple of 100, i.e. 100 is one topic of dialogue, 200 is another.
#Character replicas go after 10, i.e. 100, 110, 120, etc. With that
#for replica 100 use Node010, for replica 240 use Node024.
#For player answers - continuous numbering, i.e. the replica 650 responses will be 651, 652, 653, etc.
#For special branches use additional numbers (for example, the replica 360 is divided into 3601 and 3602,
#the same applies to the Node procedure, the answers will be in the usual form - 361, 362, etc.)
#############################################################
#Such an organizational system does not allow creating too complex dialogues,
#which for me personally is very good!!!

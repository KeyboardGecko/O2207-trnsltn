# WHAT IS IT?
# This is a broken filter unit in Laivos. PC has to repair its electric engine.
#
# Description 1
{1}{}{You see: a working filter unit.}
{2}{}{You see: a broken filter unit.}
{3}{}{You see: non-working filter unit.}

# Description 2
{4}{}{The filter works like a clock! A sight to see!}
{5}{}{No, this thing will never work.}
{6}{}{Something is wrong with this thing.}

# Actions
{7}{}{It's in excellent condition! Better not to touch it again.}
{8}{}{Everything is so wrong here... This filter will never filter anything ever again.}
{9}{}{[before you stands quite complex mechanism of the filtration unit. Different wires stick up here and there, a cloudy liquid drips from hoses. It seems that someone, who didn't really knew what he was doing, had already done some work here...]}
{10}{}{Screw it... [exit]}
{11}{}{Phew, it's too hard... [exit]}
{12}{}{[scratch your head, blow, spit and wave a hand]}

{13}{002}{[try to get into the mechanisms deeper]}
{14}{003}{[close your eyes and trust your hands]}
{15}{004}{[dismantle a non-working engine]}
{16}{005}{[violently crush the insides of mechanism]}
{17}{011}{[insert a new engine]}
{18}{006}{[try to repair the engine]}

#learn 002
{19}{}{[You are not so good with these mechanisms. You learn nothing new about the problem.]}
{20}{}{[It seems that the problem is in the electric engine. Something inside it has failed.]}

#fix 003
{21}{}{[Your movements turned out to be so clumsy and catastrophically wrong that all the mechanisms inside the apparatus gnash, something slammed, gurgled, and then everything collapsed. Looks like this is the end of the line for this filter.]}
{22}{}{[You feel that you almost get the cause of the problem... but no, you are not good enough.]}
{23}{}{[Looks like the problem is in that electric engine. Something inside it has failed.]}
{24}{}{[Incredibly, your hands seem to know what to do! With a little effort from the flywheel of the electric engine, you insert the tucked pins into its gear connections. Suddenly, you feel a vibration and a buzz! The filter is working again!]}

#mix 005
{25}{}{[You have lost track of time, while violently smashing and breaking the insides of the mechanism, until finally all the details are in an unrepairable state. Yes, this device clearly met its end.]}
{26}{}{[smugly smirk]}

#pull the engine 004
{27}{}{[not without effort, but you manage to extract the broken engine from the filter]}
{28}{}{[leave with loot]}

#engine pulled out 
{29}{}{[a gaping hole from a pulled-out electric engine is looking at you]}
{30}{}{[leave with loot]}

#engine inserted 011
{31}{}{[You carefully insert the engine into place, gently connecting all the wires and hoses. With halted breath, you wait for the results...Yes, it works!]}
{32}{}{[exit]}

SOMETHING ABOUT CLIFF:

Clifford has always been
a rather weak and sickly
boy, but he always has a
striking talent to please
everyone everywhere.
Cliff soon realized that
many problems are better
solved at the right time
and with the right words.

With his attentiveness and
sensitivity, not to mention
his winning charms, Cliff
undoubtedly awaits a high
and rising diplomat career!
